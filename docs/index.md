# CalTRACK Technical Documentation

This site represents the official technical documentation for CalTRACK, a set of open methods developed and tested through a multi-stakeholder process for estimating gross savings for residential energy efficiency programs in California.

-----

Initial draft requirements for CalTRACK were developed by the CalTRACK technical working group, tested using data from PG&E to empirically verify assumptions and identify areas of sensitivity, the modify publish official versions of the methods through an open source process. Details about the CalTRACK technical working group processes can be found [here](http://www.caltrack.org/methods-dev-process.html).

----

Communication for CalTRACK methods development happens primarily through [Github issues](https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack/issues) and using a community communication tool called Slack. The source code for this documentation, as well as results from testing, discussion, and guidance for contribution can be found on the [CalTRACK Github repository](https://github.com/impactlab/caltrack)
